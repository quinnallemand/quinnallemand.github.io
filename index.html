      <p1> This program takes your MIDI notes and then Randomizes them within the constraints of a scale such as Major Minor, or Chormatic.
      The way this works is, There are two different global Arrays, One of them, called "scales," contains the information for the scale and/or 
      key. the other is a capturing device, called "noteAdd," for a randomizer that spits out differnt index nubmers for "scales."
      I first tried to place the randomizer directly into the function that controlled the pitch and velocity of the midi notes, but
      I found that becuase this function is used twice for each hit note (once for the "noteon" and again for the "noteoff") I found
      that the MIDI input and the output would produce different numbers (causeing most of the notes to purpetuate until there was a resulting
      output pitch that matched with it). Because of this problem I found a way to place the randomizer in more of a global sense, so that
      it would still actuate when a note is pressed, but the value it produced can be inserted into the function that controlls the MIDI note number.
      After this trial and error process was complete I then just added some more keys and scales to make things more interesting,
      like that of the pentatonic scales.
